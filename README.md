# About the project

Demonstration project using the Javascript library Threejs, wich allows to create and animate 3D computer generated images in the web.

You will see a galaxy made with 3D rendered particles. Every particle is the same object, by applying a shader material to them every particle has a different color and size that changes attending to the distance from the galaxy origin and time.
